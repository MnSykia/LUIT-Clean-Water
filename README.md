# LUIT Clean Water - Hackathon Project

**🌐 Live Website:** https://luit-clean-water-plum.vercel.app/

A comprehensive water quality monitoring and management system for tracking contaminated water bodies and coordinating between PHCs (Public Health Centers) and Water Treatment Labs across Assam.

## Features

### Public Features
- **Landing Page**: View water quality status, active reports, and reported issues
- **Area Status Popup**: Get real-time status of your area's water quality (clean/contaminated)
- **Report Issue**: Submit contamination reports with GPS location, severity, and source type
- **Statistics**: View total reports, active issues, and clean areas

### PHC Dashboard
- **Active Reports**: View all contamination reports in your district
- **Send to Lab**: Forward reports to water treatment labs with descriptions
- **Mark Clean**: Mark areas as clean after lab verification
- **Hotspot Map**: View water quality hotspots on an interactive map
- **Previous Solutions**: Access past solutions from all areas of Assam or your district

### Lab Dashboard
- **Lab Assignments**: Receive and manage reports from PHCs
- **Upload Test Results**: Submit test result PDFs and notes
- **Upload Solutions**: Provide treatment solutions and recommendations
- **Confirm Clean**: Verify area is clean after treatment
- **Previous Solutions**: Access historical solutions and test results

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with Firebase credentials:
   ```
   FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_url
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
   FIREBASE_KEY_PATH=serviceAccountKey.json
   ```

4. Place your Firebase service account key JSON file in the backend directory as `serviceAccountKey.json`

5. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with Firebase config:
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   # ... other Firebase config values
   ```

4. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- Flask - Python web framework
- Firebase Admin SDK - Database and storage

## Notes

- SMS functionality is currently not implemented (to be added later)
- File uploads are stored locally; consider using cloud storage in production
- Geofencing uses simple distance calculation; can be improved with actual geofencing
- Authentication uses Firebase Auth with custom tokens

## Future Enhancements

1. SMS notification module for contamination alerts
2. Advanced geofencing with proper radius-based notifications
3. Cloud storage integration for PDFs
4. Email notifications
5. Analytics dashboard with charts and graphs
6. Admin panel for system management
7. Mobile app using React Native
8. Real-time notifications using WebSockets
